# Prediction-of-COVID-19-diagnosis using ML

This is a Corona Symptoms Based Predictive Project which is based on ML algorithms and developed using Python. Following are the information related to this project:

In this project, we have a CSV file containing the RT-PCR test results of over 250,000 individuals, along with associated symptoms. The aim is to identify which symptoms commonly appear during testing. Additionally, there is a Python notebook (.ipynb extension) where I've meticulously executed all the necessary steps, from data analysis to model development, leveraging various Python libraries.
Throughout the process, I conducted thorough analysis, hypothesis testing, and crafted a predictive model to ascertain whether a patient is positive or negative for COVID-19 based on certain information.
